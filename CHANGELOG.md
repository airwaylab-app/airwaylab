## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **IFL Symptom Risk composite metric** — new 0–100% composite that weights FL Score (35%), NED Mean (30%), Flatness Index (20%), and Glasgow Index (15%) into a single "how much is flow limitation driving symptoms" signal. Based on Gold's IFL theory and Mann et al. 2024 research. Includes MetricCard, collapsible breakdown panel, EAI contextual annotations, and integration across all exports (CSV, JSON, forum, PDF) and insights
- **IFL theory blog posts** — 3 new articles based on Dr. Gold's research: "Does Flow Limitation Drive Sleepiness?", "Arousals Don't Tell the Whole Story", "Is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale Measuring What You Think?"
- **Night context notes** — structured per-night logging (caffeine, alcohol, congestion, sleep position, stress, exercise) with free-text notes, persisted to localStorage, correlated by AI insights
- **Actionable AI insights** — AI prompt now analyses all machine settings, correlates user-reported night context, and generates concrete investigation suggestions

  - Per-night detail pages with page breaks between nights
  - Trends page with multi-line chart (Glasgow, FL Score, NED Mean, RERA) across all nights (if 2+ nights)
  - Pure string-based SVG generators in `pdf-charts.ts` (no React/DOM dependencies)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Glasgow component breakdown on Overview tab** — collapsible `<details>` section showing all 9 Glasgow components (Skew, Spike, Flat Top, Top Heavy, Multi-Peak, No Pause, Insp. Rate, Multi-Breath, Var. Amp) with values, trend arrows vs previous night, and short descriptions
- **Heatmap metric toggles** — toggle buttons in the Night-by-Night Heatmap header to show/hide individual metric rows
- **Heatmap column sorting** — click date header to sort chronologically (asc/desc), click metric row labels to sort nights by that metric's values
- **Heatmap sparklines** — optional "Trends" toggle adds a mini SVG sparkline column at the end of each metric row
- **Clickable oximetry upload from results** — "No Oximetry Data" card on the Overview tab is now clickable (when live SD files are in memory), opens a file picker for CSV upload and re-runs analysis with oximetry data
- **Inline email opt-in in controls bar** — email signup moved from bottom of results page to the controls bar (visible on sm+ screens)

### Changed

- **"Try Demo" → "See Demo"** — updated button text on landing page (`app/page.tsx`) and analyze page (`app/analyze/page.tsx`)

### Fixed

- **Page wider than viewport** — added `overflow-x: hidden` to `<html>` in `globals.css` and `overflow-x-hidden` class to `<main>` in `layout.tsx`, preventing horizontal scroll caused by wide heatmap tables or other overflowing content

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Critical: Glasgow scores always 0 on real SD card uploads** — ResMed BRP.edf files store flow data in L/s (liters per second), but the Glasgow engine thresholds (`GREY_ZONE_UPPER = 5`, `GREY_ZONE_LOWER = -10`) are calibrated for L/min. Since typical peak inspiratory flow is ~0.5 L/s (well below the threshold of 5), zero inspirations were detected and all scores returned 0. Fix: `edf-parser.ts` now detects L/s units (via `physicalDimension` field or magnitude heuristic) and multiplies flow values by 60 to convert to L/min before returning.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Root error boundary** (`app/error.tsx`) — catches unhandled runtime errors with a user-friendly recovery page (Try Again / Go Home)
- **Test suite** — 6 test files with 105 passing tests covering:
  - `thresholds.test.ts` (26 tests) — traffic-light classification for all metric thresholds
  - `insights.test.ts` (19 tests) — clinical insight generation and priority ordering
  - `export.test.ts` (9 tests) — CSV/JSON export formatting and edge cases
  - `forum-export.test.ts` (23 tests) — forum post formatting for single/multi-night
  - `persistence.test.ts` (16 tests) — localStorage save/load, expiry, size limits, corruption recovery
  - `upload-validation.test.ts` (12 tests) — file type validation, size limits, folder structure checks
- **Clipboard error handling** — visual error state (red icon + "Failed" text) when clipboard write fails
- **Vitest configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`) with jsdom environment and path aliases

### Changed

- **Parallelised file I/O** in `lib/analysis-orchestrator.ts` — `readFileList()` and `readCSVFiles()` now use `Promise.all` instead of sequential `for...of await` loops, significantly faster for large SD cards
- **Memoised derived state** in `app/analyze/page.tsx` — `nights`, `therapyChangeDate`, and `nightDates` wrapped in `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary child re-renders
- **Memoised settings diff** in `components/dashboard/settings-timeline.tsx` — `changeMap` now computed via `useMemo` instead of on every render
- **Memoised metrics array** in `components/dashboard/night-summary-card.tsx` — metric objects wrapped in `useMemo`
- **O(1) tooltip lookups** in `components/charts/trend-chart.tsx` — replaced `data.find()` with a `Map` for date label resolution
- **Wrapped components in `React.memo`** — `ExportButtons`, `SettingsTimeline`, `NightSummaryCard` now skip re-renders when props are unchanged
- **Wrapped callbacks in `useCallback`** — `toggleMetric` in `TrendChart` stabilised to prevent child re-renders
- **Standardised traffic-light colours** in `NightSummaryCard` — replaced ad-hoc `glasgowColor()` function (arbitrary 20/40/60 cutoffs) with the project-wide `getTrafficLight` + `getTrafficColor` system used everywhere else

### Fixed

- **Export crash resilience** — all export functions (`exportCSV`, `exportJSON`, `openPrintableReport`) wrapped in try-catch to prevent unhandled exceptions
- **Clipboard API fallback** — graceful degradation when `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is rejected (e.g., non-HTTPS, permission denied)

### Improved (Accessibility)

- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative hero dashboard on landing page
- Added `aria-label="Machine settings per night"` to settings timeline table
- Added `scope="col"` to all table header cells in settings timeline
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative AlertTriangle icons in settings timeline
- Added `sr-only` text ("Settings changed") for screen reader users on change indicators

### Security

- **Persistence layer** (`lib/persistence.ts`) — 7-day auto-expiry, 4MB size guard, bulk signal data stripped before storage, JSON parse wrapped in try-catch with corruption recovery
- **Upload validation** (`lib/upload-validation.ts`) — file type allowlist, 500MB per-file size limit, folder structure validation, max 365 files guard
